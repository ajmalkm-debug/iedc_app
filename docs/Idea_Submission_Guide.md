# Idea Submission Guide — IEDC LaunchPad

A guide for students on how to submit innovation ideas effectively through the LaunchPad platform.

---

## What Makes a Strong Submission

A strong innovation idea has these qualities:

- **Clearly identified clinical problem** — You've seen the problem firsthand in a ward, clinic, or hospital setting
- **Specific patient impact** — You can describe who is affected and how
- **Novel approach** — Your solution differs meaningfully from what currently exists
- **Achievable scope** — A student team can build a working prototype within 3-6 months
- **Cost awareness** — You've thought about what it would cost to build and deploy

## How to Identify Clinical Problems

The best innovations come from direct observation. Here's where to look:

- **Ward rounds** — Notice what frustrates doctors and nurses repeatedly
- **Patient interactions** — What do patients struggle with that could be solved?
- **Equipment gaps** — What imported equipment is too expensive or unavailable?
- **Process bottlenecks** — Where do delays occur in diagnosis or treatment?
- **Rural/resource-limited settings** — What solutions work in cities but fail in PHCs?

Ask yourself: "What problem did I see today that technology could solve for under ₹10,000?"

## How to Write a Good Description

Your idea description should cover:

1. **The Problem** (2-3 sentences) — What clinical situation creates the need?
2. **Your Solution** (3-4 sentences) — What will you build? How does it work?
3. **Why It's Different** (1-2 sentences) — What makes your approach better than existing solutions?
4. **Who Benefits** (1 sentence) — Which patients/staff and how many?

**Example:**
> During neonatal transport between hospitals, continuous temperature monitoring is unavailable in government ambulance incubators. We propose a low-cost flexible thermistor patch with BLE connectivity that alerts nurses via a phone app when temperature drops below safe thresholds. Unlike imported monitors costing ₹2.5L+, our solution targets ₹3,000 per unit using locally available components. This benefits approximately 500 neonatal transports annually at Govt. Medical College Thrissur alone.

## The Pipeline — What Happens After Submission

Your idea goes through a structured pipeline:

| Stage | What Happens | Duration |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Submitted** | Your idea enters the system. Admin reviews for basic feasibility | 1-2 weeks |
| **Incubating** | A mentor is assigned. You conduct research, interviews, and refine the concept | 4-6 weeks |
| **Prototyping** | Your team builds a working prototype or proof-of-concept | 6-8 weeks |
| **Validating** | Clinical testing, user feedback, iterating on the design | 4-6 weeks |
| **Complete** | Validated prototype ready for exhibition or commercialization | - |

At each stage, your mentor reviews progress and approves advancement.

## Tips for Success

- **Start with the problem, not the solution** — The best innovators deeply understand the problem before proposing a fix
- **Talk to 5 people who face the problem** — Interviews reveal insights you won't get from reading
- **Keep it simple** — The most impactful medical devices are often the simplest
- **Think about cost from day one** — A ₹50,000 solution that works beats a ₹5,00,000 solution that's unaffordable
- **Link to an existing problem** — If someone has already logged the clinical problem in the registry, link your idea to it for context
- **Be specific about materials and methods** — "Using Arduino with a pulse oximeter sensor" is better than "using IoT technology"
- **Set a timeline** — Give yourself deadlines. The hackathon and exhibition dates are real milestones

## Need Help?

- Browse the **Problem Registry** on LaunchPad for validated clinical problems waiting for solutions
- Talk to your **department faculty** about problems they observe
- Visit the **IEDC Lab** (Block C) during open hours for prototyping support
- Reach out to assigned **mentors** through the platform

Good luck innovating!
